# Random-text-with-chosable-font-size
Generate random somehow natural looking text with chosable font size

This script is written with the help of ChatGPT. 
Adjusted and prettified by me.
It just generates "text" following some rules: the "word" have to have 1-5 characters. 
After every 3-5 "word" comes a full stop.
After every full stop there it starts with upppercase. 
There are more uppercase characters but only in the beginning of every "word". 
At the very end there is also a full stop. 
Furthermore you can adjust the font size (in pixel).
I made this just for fun and to test out ChatGPT.
